## C++ projects from early 1990's and some new ones

- Code generacion using C++ compiler for a pointer manipulation code. I use a piece of C++ code (from 1990) to generate assembly code and compare how compiler technology has changed.

- An early sketch of a Motorola assembler program.

- A device control program.

- A vector element class using operator overloading technique.
